###About
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org/) at the [Johns Hopkins School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/) under the advisement of [Dr. Daniel Weinberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_R._Weinberger). 


I began my fellowship in October of 2014, as an AstraZeneca fellow (2014-2017). During my time at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org), I led an initiative to develop a small RNA sequencing protocol for estimating small RNA expression in more than 1600 brain samples. I also worked on several projects exploring gene expression alterations in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. I also co-founded the [LIBD Rstats Club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) with [Leonardo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io) and [Emily Burke](https://www.libd.org/team/emily-e-burke/).

###Graduate Work

I obtained a PhD in [Biomedical Sciences](https://hsc.unm.edu/research/brep/graduate/bsgp/index.html) at the [University of New Mexico School of Medicine](https://som.unm.edu/).  

My doctorate work was performed at the [University of New Mexico School of Medicine](https://som.unm.edu/) and the [Mind Research Network](https://www.mrn.org/). I was co-advised by [Dr. Nora Perrone-Bizzozero](https://hsc.unm.edu/nmarc/directory/researcher-profiles/nora-perrone-bizzozero.html), an expert of post-transcriptional gene regulation of nervous system development and [Dr. Jessica Turner](http://psychology.gsu.edu/profile/jessica-turner/), an expert of neuroinformatics and imaging genetics. With their mentorship, I wrote several of the first publications characterizing the potential influence of genetic variants within the microRNA137 (miR-137) host gene and the genes regulated by miR-137 within the context of schizophrenia.
