### About

&nbsp;

Carrie Wright is a Research Associate in the Department of [Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH)](https://www.jhsph.edu/). Dr. Wright is a member of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab (DaSL)](https://jhudatascience.org/), the [Open Case Studies](https://opencasestudies.github.io/) team, and the [Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Training Network (ITN)](https://www.itcrtraining.org/).  Dr. Wright's work is focused on innovating ways to make data science and computational biology more accessable to audiences of varied computational experience.

Prior to joining the JHSPH, Dr. Wright was a Posdoctoral Fellow at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD)](https://www.libd.org/), where her research focused on uncovering genetic mechanisms in psychiatric disease through the utilization of data science tools. At LIBD, Dr. Wright co-founded the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/), a community designed to encourage others to learn more about R programming and statistics. Dr. Wright has also served as an instructor for the [Baltimore Underground Science Space](http://www.bugssonline.org/) and the [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](https://cty.jhu.edu/).

### Training

#### Postdoctoral Work

&nbsp;

Dr. Wright was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org/) at the [Johns Hopkins School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/) under the advisement of [Dr. Daniel Weinberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_R._Weinberger) from 2014 - 2019.


She began her fellowship in October of 2014, as an AstraZeneca fellow (2014 - 2017). During her time at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org), she led an initiative to develop a small RNA sequencing protocol for estimating small RNA expression in more than 1600 brain samples. She also worked on several projects exploring gene expression alterations in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Dr. Wright also co-founded the [LIBD Rstats Club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) with [Leonardo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io) and [Emily Burke](https://www.libd.org/team/emily-e-burke/).

#### Graduate Work

&nbsp;

Dr. Wright obtained a PhD in [Biomedical Sciences](https://hsc.unm.edu/research/brep/graduate/bsgp/index.html) at the [University of New Mexico School of Medicine](https://som.unm.edu/).  

Dr. Wright's graduate work was performed at the [University of New Mexico School of Medicine](https://som.unm.edu/) and the [Mind Research Network](https://www.mrn.org/). She was co-advised by [Dr. Nora Perrone-Bizzozero](https://hsc.unm.edu/nmarc/directory/researcher-profiles/nora-perrone-bizzozero.html), an expert of post-transcriptional gene regulation of nervous system development and [Dr. Jessica Turner](http://psychology.gsu.edu/profile/jessica-turner/), an expert of neuroinformatics and imaging genetics. With their mentorship, Dr. Wright wrote several of the first publications characterizing the potential influence of genetic variants within the microRNA137 (miR-137) host gene and the genes regulated by miR-137 within the context of schizophrenia.
